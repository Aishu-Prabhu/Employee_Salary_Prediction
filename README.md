Project Title: Employee Salary Prediction using AI/ML
Description:
This project aims to predict whether an employee earns more than 50K or less than or equal to 50K annually based on various demographic and employment-related features. Using Machine Learning models, the system helps identify salary patterns based on inputs like education, occupation, age, marital status, and more.

Key Features:
Trained on the UCI Adult Income Dataset

Implements preprocessing techniques like label encoding and feature scaling

Uses classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest

Deployed using a Streamlit web app for user-friendly interaction

Tech Stack:
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Streamlit

Pickle (for saving ML model)

Objective:
To demonstrate the use of AI/ML in HR analytics and salary classification for workforce planning.
